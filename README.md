Step 2 : Run the globalAlignment.py file in your local terminal by typing the following command. 
         
         python3 globalAlignment.py 

Step 3 : Run the localAlignment.py file in your local terminal by typing the following command. 
         
         python3 localAlignment.py 

Step 4 : In line-190 of the globalAlignment.py file you can change the DNA sequences as per your choice, and accordingly obtain the required Global Alignment and matrix for the inputed DNA sequences.

Step 5 : In line-193 of the localAlignment.py file you can change the DNA sequences as per your choice, and accordingly obtain the required Global Alignment and matrix for the inputed DNA sequences.

Step 6 : In the writeup.pdf I have neatly documented all the differences in the output as well.
